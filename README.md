# A-Maze-Solver
This a python based maze solver which visualizes the A* algorithm on a grid where we can put on a start and end point and can set up a maze. The objective is to find the optimal or shortest path to reach from the start point to the end point avoiding the walls.

Imagine a square grid which possesses many obstacles, scattered randomly. The initial and the final cell is provided. The aim is to reach the final cell in the shortest time.

The following project, focuses on the application of the A* algorithm, and combines it  with the visualization part. A* algorithm is a searching algorithm that searches for the most  optimal/shortest path between the initial and final state. This project, focuses on the basic utilization of A* algorithm, i.e. path  detection in a grid.  

1. Grid Layout

2. Setting up start and end point and barrier

3. How the algorithm works
The algorithm is visualized in such a way that, when it is scanning, the grid is lit up green where the scanning is being done, and the scanned nodes/paths are marked as red
